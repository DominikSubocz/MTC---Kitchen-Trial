# MTC Trial - MY HANDMADE KITCHEN

## Overview

This project is a responsive website showcasing high-quality handmade kitchen designs. It features a slideshow of kitchen images, customer reviews section, small expandable gallery section and a mobile-friendly navigation menu.
No libraries were used, the website was entirely made using my techniques.

This quite a challenging project, for which I had only 5 days to complete, and only desktop design.

## Features

- Slideshow of kitchen images with automatic cycling.
- Customer reviews section with navigation buttons.
- Small expandable gallery.
- Mobile-friendly navigation menu with open and close functionality.
- Responsive design using modern CSS techniques.

## Implementation Notes
Heading Levels: Used '<h6>' instead of '<h5>' for the small text above larger headings as it matched the design more closely. The <h5> in the design was 18px, while the intended element was smaller, at 13px.
Font Awesome Icons: Used an alternative Font Awesome icon for chevrons as the Pro version was not available.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event handling)
- FontAwesome for icons
